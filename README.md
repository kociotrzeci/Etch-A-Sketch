# Etch-A-Sketch

Project to use just lerned things in HTML and JS. 

In this project i had possibility to work with everything i learned in The Odin Project so far. There were:
- flexbox,
- DOM manipulation in JS,
- event listeners.
My biggest discovery was cloneNode() method, that, unfortunely, had no usecase in my view, because it doesn't copy event listeners.
